## Subroutines - Key Concept

The key idea here is that when we use subroutines our code will no longer run in line order.  Instead it will jump from the main program to each subroutine called and back again.

It is extremely useful to spend time with your students tracing examples and getting them to tell you which line number will execute next until you are satisfied that they have grasped the concept.  

[This Python visualiser website is excellent for this](http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) - paste the code in and watch it run line by line. 

## Investigate
The ‘investigate’ stage gives students some example code and asks them questions about it to check their understanding.  I use the [block model](https://helloworld.raspberrypi.org/articles/hw14-the-i-in-primm)  to plan my questions.  Try it, it's really useful.

## Misconceptions & Errors to Watch Out For

- The subroutine name is identical everywhere it is used (capitals matter)
- The subroutine call is **not** indented inside the subroutine
- The subroutine is defined **before** it has been called
